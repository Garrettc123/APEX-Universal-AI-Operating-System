## 📊 Quick Decision Trees

### "Should I Do This in 7 Days or Take Longer?"

**Choose 7-Day Blitz If:**
- ✅ You can dedicate 4-5 hours per day for 7 consecutive days
- ✅ You have $2,826 available to invest immediately
- ✅ You want maximum speed and momentum
- ✅ You're comfortable working in parallel on multiple tasks
- ✅ You have all required documents ready (Gov ID, SSN, address proof)

**Choose 2-4 Week Approach If:**
- ⚠️ You can only dedicate 2-3 hours per day
- ⚠️ Budget is tight and you need to spread costs
- ⚠️ You prefer to complete one task fully before starting another
- ⚠️ You need more time to gather required documents

**Reality Check:** The 7-day approach is 330% more efficient but requires intense focus.

### "Which Documents Should I Print?"

**Must Print:**
- ✅ DAILY_EXECUTION_CARD.md (all 7 days) - Post on wall
- ✅ vendor_and_provider_guide.md (vendor contact section) - Keep on desk

**Consider Printing:**
- ⚠️ implementation_checklists.md (templates section) - For quick reference
- ⚠️ ACCELERATED_7_DAY_BLITZ.md (parallel work streams) - For planning

**Keep Digital:**
- 📱 All other documents (access on laptop/tablet during work)

### "What If I Get Stuck?"

**Problem: Can't complete a task on the scheduled day**
**Solution:** 
1. Mark task as "blocked" with reason
2. Continue with next parallel task
3. Revisit blocked task next day
4. Most tasks have alternatives in vendor_and_provider_guide.md

**Problem: Vendor doesn't respond within expected timeframe**
**Solution:**
1. Check vendor_and_provider_guide.md for alternative provider
2. Call backup vendor immediately (phone numbers provided)
3. Don't wait - speed is critical

**Problem: Unexpected cost higher than estimated**
**Solution:**
1. Check if task can be deferred to Week 2-4
2. Review business_infrastructure_action_items.md for "must have vs nice to have"
3. Legal entity, EIN, and bank account are non-negotiable
4. Some insurance and tools can be added in Week 2

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Analysis Paralysis
**Problem:** Spending too much time researching options  
**Solution:** Use the pre-vetted vendors. You can optimize later.

### 2. Perfectionism
**Problem:** Trying to make everything perfect before launching  
**Solution:** Launch with "good enough" and improve iteratively.

### 3. Sequential Execution
**Problem:** Waiting for one task to complete before starting another  
**Solution:** Work in parallel using the 4 work streams in ACCELERATED_7_DAY_BLITZ.md

### 4. Vendor Delays
**Problem:** Waiting days for a vendor response  
**Solution:** Call, don't just email. Use backup vendors immediately.

### 5. Scope Creep
**Problem:** Adding "just one more thing" to the launch plan  
**Solution:** Stick to the plan. Everything else goes in Week 2+.

### 6. Ignoring Metrics
**Problem:** Not tracking progress daily  
**Solution:** Update metrics spreadsheet every evening. It keeps you accountable.

### 7. Poor Time Management
**Problem:** Underestimating how long tasks take  
**Solution:** Use time estimates in daily cards. Set timers.
