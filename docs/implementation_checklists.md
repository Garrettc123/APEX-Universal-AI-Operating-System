## Cold Email Templates

### Template 1: Value-First Approach
```
Subject: 10,000x faster AI decision-making for [Company Name]

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] is [specific observation about their business/tech stack].

We built APEX specifically for companies like yours that need enterprise-grade AI infrastructure without the complexity.

APEX has helped similar companies:
• Reduce AI inference time from 800ms to 0.003ms (266x faster)
• Cut AI infrastructure costs by 40%
• Achieve 99.999% uptime

Would a 15-minute demo make sense? I can show you exactly how we'd integrate with your current stack.

Best,
[Your Name]
Founder, APEX AI Systems
[Calendly link]
```

### Template 2: Problem-Agitation-Solution
```
Subject: Are you spending $50K+/month on AI infrastructure?

Hi [First Name],

Most companies we talk to are overpaying for AI infrastructure that's:
❌ Slow (800ms+ response times)
❌ Expensive ($50K-200K/month)
❌ Fragile (99.9% uptime at best)

We built APEX to solve this. Our customers get:
✅ 0.003ms response times (266x faster)
✅ $2.50 per 1M requests (94% cost reduction)
✅ 99.999% uptime (self-healing)

[Company Name] could save $480K+ annually while improving performance.

15-minute demo? [Calendly link]

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Template 3: Social Proof
```
Subject: How [Competitor] reduced AI costs by 40% with APEX

Hi [First Name],

[Competitor Company] was facing the same challenge most AI-first companies face: expensive, slow infrastructure that didn't scale.

After switching to APEX:
• AI inference time dropped from 950ms to 0.003ms
• Infrastructure costs down 42%
• Uptime improved to 99.999%

They're now processing 1B+ API requests per day with zero downtime.

I'd love to show you how APEX could deliver similar results for [Company Name].

15 minutes next week? [Calendly link]

Best,
[Your Name]
Founder, APEX AI Systems
```

## Follow-Up Email Templates

### Follow-Up #1 (2 days after initial)
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my email from [Day]. 

Quick question: What's your current biggest AI infrastructure challenge?
• Performance/speed?
• Cost optimization?
• Reliability/uptime?
• All of the above?

Happy to share how we've solved this for companies like [Similar Company].

[Your Name]
```

### Follow-Up #2 (5 days after initial)
```
Subject: [Company Name] + APEX: Quick question

Hi [First Name],

Last email - I don't want to be a pest!

Would love to hear if:
1. This is a priority for [Company Name] right now
2. There's someone else I should connect with
3. Better to circle back in Q2

Either way, thanks for your time.

[Your Name]
```

### Follow-Up #3 (Breaking up email)
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [First Name],

Haven't heard back, so I'm assuming:
• Not a priority right now
• Wrong timing
• Not the right person

Should I close your file, or is this worth a 15-minute conversation?

Let me know!
[Your Name]
```
