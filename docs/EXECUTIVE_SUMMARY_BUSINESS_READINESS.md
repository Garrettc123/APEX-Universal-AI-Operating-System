## 🎯 Critical Success Factors

### 1. Speed of Execution (Weight: 30%)
**Why It Matters:** Every day of delay costs momentum and allows competitors to gain ground. The 7-day intensive creates unstoppable momentum.

**How to Achieve:**
- Block calendar completely (Jan 6-12)
- Work in parallel (4 simultaneous work streams)
- Use provided templates (no reinventing)
- Make decisions quickly (80% solution is good enough)

**Risk if Missed:** Momentum loss, motivation decay, opportunity cost

### 2. Financial Discipline (Weight: 20%)
**Why It Matters:** Proper financial infrastructure prevents legal issues, enables fundraising, and builds credibility.

**How to Achieve:**
- Follow accounting best practices from day 1
- Separate personal and business finances completely
- Track all expenses and revenue meticulously
- Maintain proper insurance coverage

**Risk if Missed:** Legal liability, audit issues, loss of credibility

### 3. Sales Excellence (Weight: 25%)
**Why It Matters:** No revenue = no business. Sales execution determines success or failure.

**How to Achieve:**
- Personalize every outreach (no spam)
- Focus on value, not features
- Follow up persistently (5-7 touches)
- Learn from every conversation

**Risk if Missed:** No revenue, cash burn, business failure

### 4. Customer Success (Weight: 15%)
**Why It Matters:** Happy customers stay, refer, and expand. Unhappy customers churn and damage reputation.

**How to Achieve:**
- Over-deliver on promises
- Respond to issues within 2 hours
- Proactive check-ins (weekly)
- Build genuine relationships

**Risk if Missed:** High churn, poor reputation, negative growth

### 5. Adaptability (Weight: 10%)
**Why It Matters:** Plans are guides, not gospel. Market feedback may require pivots.

**How to Achieve:**
- Listen to customer feedback intently
- Be willing to adjust pricing/positioning
- Iterate quickly on what's not working
- Stay focused on outcomes, not methods

**Risk if Missed:** Building wrong product, missing market signals

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Impact Risks

#### Risk 1: Vendor Delays (Probability: 30%, Impact: High)
**Scenario:** LegalZoom or Mercury takes longer than expected

**Mitigation:**
- Have backup vendors pre-vetted
- Call vendors directly (don't just email)
- Start applications early in the day
- Consider expedited services

**Backup Plan:** Alternative incorporation services (FirstBase, Stripe Atlas)

#### Risk 2: Insufficient Capital (Probability: 15%, Impact: Critical)
**Scenario:** Don't have full $2,826 available

**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize must-haves (legal entity, EIN, bank account)
- Defer nice-to-haves (some insurance can wait 1 week)
- Use credit card with rewards
- Consider 0% APR financing

**Backup Plan:** Launch with minimum ($900: legal + domain)

#### Risk 3: No Customer Response (Probability: 40%, Impact: High)
**Scenario:** Cold emails generate no demos

**Mitigation:**
- A/B test email templates
- Personalize every email
- Multi-channel outreach (email + LinkedIn)
- Offer time-limited incentives

**Backup Plan:** Leverage network for warm intros, pivot messaging

#### Risk 4: First Customer Lost (Probability: 25%, Impact: Medium)
**Scenario:** Verbally committed customer doesn't sign

**Mitigation:**
- Get written commitments early
- Offer flexible terms
- Address objections immediately
- Have multiple prospects in pipeline

**Backup Plan:** Focus on next 3 prospects, learn from loss

### Medium-Impact Risks

#### Risk 5: Technical Issues (Probability: 35%, Impact: Medium)
**Scenario:** Website goes down or demo fails

**Mitigation:**
- Use reliable hosting (Vercel 99.99% uptime)
- Test demo environment daily
- Have backup demo recording
- Practice demo multiple times

**Backup Plan:** Screen share local environment, apologize and reschedule

#### Risk 6: Pricing Uncertainty (Probability: 50%, Impact: Medium)
**Scenario:** Not sure what to charge

**Mitigation:**
- Start with value-based pricing
- Research competitor pricing
- Test 3 price points
- Be willing to adjust

**Backup Plan:** Anchor high ($50K enterprise), negotiate down
