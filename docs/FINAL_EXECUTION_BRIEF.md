## ⚠️ Top 5 Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: Vendor Delays
**Probability:** 30% | **Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Start applications early in the day (8 AM)
- Call vendors directly (don't just email)
- Have backup vendors ready (2nd choice pre-selected)
- Pay for expedited service ($50-100 worth it)
- Continue other streams if blocked

**Backup Vendors:**
- Mercury delayed → Try Brex or Novo
- LegalZoom delayed → Try FirstBase or Stripe Atlas
- Hiscox delayed → Try Next Insurance

### Risk 2: Insufficient Capital
**Probability:** 15% | **Impact:** Critical

**Mitigation:**
- Verify $2,826 available before Day 1
- Use business credit card with rewards
- Consider 0% APR card for first year
- Prioritize must-haves: legal ($648), insurance ($1,300), bank ($0)
- Defer nice-to-haves: some tools can wait

**Minimum Viable Investment:** $648 (legal) + $12 (domain) = $660

### Risk 3: No Customer Response
**Probability:** 40% | **Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Personalize every email (no templates without customization)
- A/B test subject lines (track what works)
- Multi-channel (email + LinkedIn + Twitter)
- Leverage warm introductions (ask network)
- Offer time-limited incentives (early adopter discount)

**If Still No Response:**
- Pivot messaging (different pain point)
- Try different industries
- Offer free pilot (30 days)
- Focus on network referrals

### Risk 4: Technical Issues
**Probability:** 35% | **Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Use reliable platforms (Vercel 99.99% uptime)
- Test everything before launch (staging environment)
- Have backup demo recording (if live demo fails)
- Practice demo 3+ times
- Keep it simple (complex features can wait)

**Emergency Backup:**
- Website down → Use Loom video + PDF deck
- Demo fails → Screen share local environment
- Email not working → Use personal email temporarily

### Risk 5: Founder Burnout
**Probability:** 25% | **Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Pace yourself (4-5 hours/day, not 12)
- Take mandatory breaks (10 min every 90 min)
- Get 7-8 hours sleep (performance multiplier)
- Celebrate small wins (dopamine hits matter)
- Remember why you started (vision > tactics)

**Warning Signs:**
- Can't focus (brain fog)
- Making silly mistakes
- Feeling overwhelmed
- Skipping breaks

**Solution:** Take rest of day off, resume tomorrow

## 🎯 Key Decision Points

### Decision 1: Sequential vs. Parallel Execution
**When:** Day 0 (before starting)  
**Options:**
- Traditional (21 days, sequential, familiar)
- Accelerated (7 days, parallel, intense)

**Recommendation:** Accelerated (330% more efficient)  
**Why:** Momentum matters, time is money, prove speed to yourself

### Decision 2: DIY vs. LegalZoom
**When:** Day 1, Hour 1  
**Options:**
- DIY ($89, 1-2 weeks, requires legal knowledge)
- LegalZoom ($648, 1-2 days, handled for you)

**Recommendation:** LegalZoom (speed > cost)  
**Why:** $559 premium for 10-12 days saved = $56/day (cheap)

### Decision 3: Traditional Bank vs. Mercury
**When:** Day 2  
**Options:**
- Chase/BofA ($15/month, branches, slow approval)
- Mercury ($0/month, no branches, 24-48 hour approval)

**Recommendation:** Mercury (built for startups)  
**Why:** Free, fast, excellent UX, integrates with everything

### Decision 4: Basic vs. Premium Insurance
**When:** Day 2-3  
**Options:**
- Minimum ($1M liability, no cyber, $500/year)
- Recommended ($2M liability + $1M cyber, $1,300/year)

**Recommendation:** Full coverage (required for enterprise)  
**Why:** Can't sell to enterprise without it, shows credibility

### Decision 5: Weekend Work vs. Wait Until Monday
**When:** Days 6-7 (Saturday/Sunday)  
**Options:**
- Work weekend (send emails, finish Week 1)
- Take weekend off (start sales Monday)

**Recommendation:** Work weekend (momentum critical)  
**Why:** Prospects check email on weekends, you want demos Week 2
